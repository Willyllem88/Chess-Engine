# TASKS PENDING

Here I will list the pending tasks. Just to not forget those ideas that might benefit the project.

## VERY IMPORTANT



## FIX SHORT TERM

* Think of all possible moves before the players makes the click. (goas also with the other one)
* It will render only when a move its done.
* Provide en passant behaviour

# FIX LONG TERM

* Improve the GUI, adding sound (easy) and visualize the movement (hard, i think)
