# TASKS PENDING

Here I will list the pending tasks. Just to not forget those ideas that might benefit the project.

## TO DO

* Give some information when executing without arguments
* Handle all arguments
* The ENGINE

## FIX SHORT TERM

* It will render only when a move its done.

# FIX LONG TERM

* Test it with real chess data, in order to find possible errors. A function that reads chess moves in ascii and playis it in the board.
* Improve the GUI, adding sound (easy) and visualize the movement (hard, i think)
