# TASKS PENDING

Here I will list the pending tasks and the bugs and issues that should be addressed.

## High Priority

## Low Priority

- Add more const member functions.
- Better files handling, for the engine, for e.g., transposition table in another class etc
- PieceMoveToAlgebraic could write also # and + if is checkmate or check.
- Improve the GUI, maybe with qt, adding buttons

## Bugs and issues

## Possible optimitzations

- When calculating the targeted squares, use more bitwise operations.
- When manageCheck() and eliminatePinnedMoves() don't create class Board copies.
