# TASKS PENDING

Here I will list the pending tasks. Just to not forget those ideas that might benefit the project.

## TO DO

* Give some information when executing without arguments
* Handle all arguments
* The ENGINE
* A function that translates chess algebraic notation to ijMove

## FIX SHORT TERM

* If a pawn is dragged to the back rank the promote window pops up, even if the pawn is too far to promote. Although the move counts as invalid, it should be fixed. Still issues when trying to promote and is not the promotion turn. Might change some parts of the code in order to do it.
* It will render only when a move its done.

# FIX LONG TERM

* Test it with real chess data, in order to find possible errors. A function that reads chess moves in ascii and playis it in the board.
* Improve the GUI, adding sound (easy) and visualize the movement (hard, i think)
