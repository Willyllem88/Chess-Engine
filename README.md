# Guillem's Chess Engine

This is a project made by Guillem Cabr√©. Its purpose is to learn how a Chess Engine works, using algorithmic experience and learning from other projects to gain expertise in computer science. The program features a simple GUI for users to interact with the game using the cursor.

The project is implemented in C++.

## Requirements

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
* You have installed `g++`
* `cmake` is installed
* You have `libsdl2-dev`, `libsdl2-image-dev`, `libsdl2-mixer-dev` installed

If these are not installed, please refer to the section [Installing Dependencies on Ubuntu/Debian](#installing-dependencies-on-ubuntudebian).

### Installing Dependencies on Ubuntu/Debian

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following commands:

```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install g++ cmake libsdl2-dev libsdl2-image-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev
```

## Compiling and Executing

1. **Build the project**:

   ```sh
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```

2. **Executing the Program**:

   After compiling, the executable file is `engine`, to see its options use `--help`.

   ```sh
   ./engine <options>
   ```
   
3. **Cleaning the Build**:

   To clean the directory of object files and executables, use:

   ```sh
   make clean
   ```

   In order to clean the entire build, use:

   ```sh
   make distclean
   ```

The executable file will be named `engine`.

### Executing Options

The options are specified using the `-option` format:
* `-h` or `--help`: Displays a usage message.
* `-b <Player | <engine_name>>` or `--black <Player | <engine_name>>`: Specifies who will play with the black pieces.
* `-w <Player | <engine_name>>` or `--white <Player | <engine_name>>`: Specifies who will play with the white pieces.
* `-c` or `--console-only`: Runs the program without the GUI, allowing moves to be entered via the console.
* `-t <seconds>` or `--timespan <seconds>`: Sets the time span (in seconds) that the engine will take to make a move after its opponent. Can handle decimals.
* `-f "<fen>"` or `--load-fen "<fen>"`: Loads a FEN (Forsyth-Edwards_Notation) position to the board. Visit [FEN documentation](https://www.chess.com/terms/fen-chess). Important: The FEN string must be enclosed in quotes. If not specified, the initial board will be set to the default position.

The default values are `--white Player`, `--black Player`, and `--timespan 2`.

#### Example Usage

To run the program with a player as white and an engine named "EngineV1" as black, with a timespan of 2.5 seconds, and displaying it through the console, with an example FEN string, use:

```sh
./engine -w Player -b EngineV1 -t 2.5 -c -f "4k2r/6r1/8/8/8/8/3R4/R3K3 w Qk - 0 1"
```

### Commands

During the execution of the program, the user can enter the following commands:
* `u` or `undo`: Undoes the last move. The user can undo multiple moves until the initial board is reached.
* `<algebraic-move-notation>`: if it's a valid move, it will perform it.
